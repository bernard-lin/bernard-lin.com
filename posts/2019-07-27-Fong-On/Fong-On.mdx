There's a phrase in Chinese that describes businesses and implies both their historical prestige and mastery of craft: 百年老店 (bǎinián lǎodiàn), which translates as "century-old shop".

From 1933 until 2017, the Eng family made and sold rice and soy derived foods at what became Fong Inn Too on Mott St in Chinatown. I remember discovering it in high school on one of my first solo trips into NYC and stopping by to pick up some rice noodles and soy milk. Though that location was sold, Paul Eng has revived the family business at 81 Division St where tofu production happened under its original name, Fong On (宏安), with a sleek new buildout.

Douhua (豆花) is a pudding made with very soft tofu and usually served around NYC with a simple ginger syrup. I reached for my Taiwanese roots with grass jelly, aiyu jelly, and red bean in addition. In an age where too many restaurants are closing before their time is up, it's good to see a stalwart of nearly a century roar back to life.
